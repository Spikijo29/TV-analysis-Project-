Introduction

BrightTV is at a critical stage of its growth journey, seeking to expand its subscription base and improve customer engagement. As a digital streaming platform, BrightTV’s success relies heavily on understanding its audience’s viewing patterns, preferences, and behaviors. With the rapid rise of competition in the digital media landscape, it has become essential for the company to leverage data-driven insights to guide decision-making. The analysis of viewership data offers an opportunity to uncover trends in user consumption, identify peak and off-peak viewing times, and examine demographic and content preferences. These insights will form the basis for strategies aimed at driving both user engagement and revenue growth

Problem Statement

Despite having a solid platform and a diverse content library, BrightTV faces challenges in fully maximizing its consumption potential across different customer segments and time periods. Current data shows fluctuations in viewership, with noticeable dips during certain days and times, which may indicate gaps in programming alignment with audience demand. Additionally, limited understanding of the factors that drive engagement—such as content genre, time of day, or demographic alignment—creates uncertainty in targeting users effectively. Without addressing these challenges, the company risks stagnation in its subscriber base and may fall behind competitors who better harness their analytics capabilities.

Aim

The primary aim of this analysis is to provide the new CEO with a clear and comprehensive understanding of BrightTV’s current viewership landscape. By leveraging the dataset of user profiles and viewing sessions, the analysis seeks to uncover actionable insights into consumption trends, behavioral drivers, and opportunities for improvement. Ultimately, the aim is to equip leadership with data-backed recommendations that not only optimize current content offerings but also enhance customer value management strategies, ensuring sustainable growth of the subscription base.

Objectives of the Analysis

The analysis has four main objectives. First, to explore user and usage trends in order to establish a baseline understanding of how BrightTV’s customers interact with the platform. Second, to identify the key factors influencing consumption, including demographic variables, content types, and viewing times. Third, to recommend targeted content strategies that can boost consumption during low-traffic periods, thereby improving overall engagement and retention. Finally, to propose broader initiatives—such as product enhancements, marketing campaigns, or partnership opportunities—that will help BrightTV expand its subscriber base and strengthen its competitive positioning in the market. Together, these objectives ensure that the analysis delivers both immediate operational insights and long-term strategic value.
